# Portfolio

A [personal project](https://johnjohncode.github.io/portfolio/) where I introduce me, myself and I to anyone interested. 

This portfolio contains a home section, an about me section where I describe myself, a tech stack section where I list all the amazing things I am able to do, a projects section where I showcase projects that I have created and finally a contact section in which I list ways of reaching me.
